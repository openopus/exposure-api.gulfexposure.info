Users of the app are anonymous.  The do not have usernames, email
addresses, passwords, etc.  On the frontend, we may allow a security
feature that prevents use of the app unless a biometric result from
the phone OS is used, or a pin code entered, but that is unrelated to
the server.  The users may be given codenames so that they can be
addressed, and they can identify that they are the correct user of the
app.

In the app, a unique identifier for that install is created.  That
identifier is used to create and access a corresponding user record on
the server.  The user record has associated survey answers, and
location information.  Authoring information may be included.
